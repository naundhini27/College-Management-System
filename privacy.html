            What follows is just some placeholder text for this modal dialog. You just gotta ignite the light 
            and let it shine! Come just as you are to me. Just own the night like the 4th of July. Infect me with 
            your love and fill me with your poison. Come just as you are to me. End of the rainbow looking treasure.

            I can't sleep let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back. I can't sleep let's run 
            away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back. Yes, we make angels cry, raining down on earth 
            from up above. I'm walking on air (tonight). Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans. 
            Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes. I went from zero, to my own hero. Even brighter than the 
            moon, moon, moon. Make 'em go, 'Aah, aah, aah' as you shoot across the sky-y-y! Why don't you let me 
            stop by?

            We'd keep all our promises be us against the world. In another life I would be your girl. We can 
            dance, until we die, you and I, will be young forever. And on my 18th Birthday we got matching 
            tattoos. So open up your heart and just let it begin. 'Cause she's the muse and the artist. 
            She eats your heart out. Like Jeffrey Dahmer (woo). Pop your confetti. (This is how we do) I 
            know one spark will shock the world, yeah yeah. If you only knew what the future holds.

            Sipping on Rosé, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy. It’s in the palm of your hand now baby. 
            So we hit the boulevard. So make a wish, I'll make it like your birthday everyday. Do you ever 
            feel already buried deep six feet under? It's time to bring out the big balloons. 
            You could've been the greatest. Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Your kiss is cosmic, 
            every move is magic.
