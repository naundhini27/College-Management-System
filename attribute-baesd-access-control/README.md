# Attribute Based Access Control

**A researched project that implements Attribute-Based Access Control in an EHR system. By encrypting EHRs using policies defined based on specific attributes, health care systems can be able to restrict how a data is accessed and what each user can do to the data being accessed.**


The `key.pem` and `keypair.pem` has been left intentionally due to many students reaching out for a way to use this project in their project but don't have any much of technical experience.
